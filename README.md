# RotorRE
Collection of files from my IPM Rotor 2 reverse engineering project
For all the info, see https://hackaday.io/project/181937-reverse-engineering-the-rotor

The "schematics" folder contains schematics for the board I've traced so far. Note that that there are different revisions of some of the boards with minimal differences. The revisions I actually traced are reported in the folders; designators in the files match the designators on the physical board, and as far as I know they should match between revisions.

The "hitachi" folder contains the original manual for the HD6305 processor used in the phone AND the Ghidra module I wrote to decompile the ROMs.

Parts of the original manual (taken from the old Spaghetti Phreakers website) can be found in the "manual" folder

There's also some of the pictures I took of the internals in the "pics" folder.

I DO have binary images of the ROMs for the boards I have, both for the phone and for the internal card reader. I won't post them here since it's still technically copyrighted code. All of the phone CPU boards in my possession are equipped with ROM version 1.11 from '91, while my card readers have two different FW revisions. Not 100% of the differences yet. I haven't worked on the newer "OV" revisions board yet and I don't plan to unless I absolutely have to.
